Please look at the general comments to see if any apply.

Consider using ?: when

public void addNotes(final String notes) {
    if (meetingNotes == "") {
      meetingNotes = notes;
    } else {
      meetingNotes += "\n" + notes;
    }
  }

Excellent documentation.

Good set of tests.

Correct structure.

Excellent submission. Distinction.
